# CSS Grid vs Flexbox: When to Use Each

Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout tools, but they serve different purposes. Understanding when to use each one will make you a more effective web developer.

## Flexbox: One-Dimensional Layouts

Flexbox is designed for **one-dimensional layouts** - either a row or a column.

### Best Use Cases for Flexbox

- **Navigation bars**
- **Button groups**
- **Centering content**
- **Distributing space between items**
- **Aligning items in a container**

### Flexbox Example

\`\`\`css
.navbar {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}

.button-group {
  display: flex;
  gap: 1rem;
}
\`\`\`

## CSS Grid: Two-Dimensional Layouts

CSS Grid is designed for **two-dimensional layouts** - both rows and columns simultaneously.

### Best Use Cases for CSS Grid

- **Page layouts**
- **Card grids**
- **Complex forms**
- **Magazine-style layouts**
- **Any layout with both rows and columns**

### CSS Grid Example

\`\`\`css
.page-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header"
    "sidebar main"
    "footer footer";
  grid-template-columns: 250px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
}

.card-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}
\`\`\`

## When to Use Which?

### Choose Flexbox When:
- You need to align items in one direction
- You want to distribute space between items
- You're working with navigation or button layouts
- You need to center content

### Choose CSS Grid When:
- You need to control both rows and columns
- You're creating a page layout
- You want to overlap elements
- You need precise control over item placement

## Can You Use Both Together?

They work great together:

\`\`\`css
.page {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;
}

.sidebar {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 1rem;
}
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

Don't think of Grid vs Flexbox as an either/or choice. They're complementary tools:

- **CSS Grid** for the overall page structure
- **Flexbox** for component-level layouts

Master both, and you'll be able to create any layout you can imagine!
