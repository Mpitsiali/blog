Welcome to this post! It demonstrates all the features of this JS-powered blog.

### Markdown is Easy

You can write in plain text, and it gets converted to beautiful HTML. You can have **bold text**, _italic text_, and links like [this one to Google](https://google.com).

### Syntax Highlighting

Here is a JavaScript code block that will be automatically styled by Highlight.js.

```javascript
// This is a javascript code block
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```
