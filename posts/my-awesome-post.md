This is the beginning of my blog post. I can write paragraphs here.

I can use **bold text**, _italic text_, and all other standard Markdown features.

### Subheadings are easy

Code blocks are also supported and will be highlighted automatically.

```javascript
console.log("Hello from a Markdown file!");

**3. Add the File to the Post Index**
Open `assets/js/posts.js` and add your new filename to the `postFiles` list. **Add it to the top of the list** to make sure it appears first on the homepage.

```javascript
// assets/js/posts.js
const postFiles = [
    'my-awesome-post.md', // <-- Add your new file here
    'a-post-with-features.md',
    'my-second-post.md',
    'hello-world.md',
];
